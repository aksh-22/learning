### Concurrency & Parallelism Notes

#### 1. What is Concurrency?

- Concurrency is about **dealing with multiple tasks at the same time**, but not necessarily simultaneously.
- Example: In JavaScript, async programming allows tasks to progress without waiting for others to complete.

#### 2. What is Parallelism?

- Parallelism is about **executing multiple tasks simultaneously**, often using multi-threading or multiple processes.
- Example: Using worker threads in Node.js to process data in parallel.

#### 3. Key Differences

| **Feature**   | **Concurrency**                                         | **Parallelism**                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution** | Tasks may overlap but not necessarily at the same time. | Tasks run simultaneously across threads or cores. |
| **Goal**      | Manage multiple tasks efficiently.                      | Speed up execution by dividing work.              |
| **Example**   | Async/await, Event Loop in Node.js.                     | Multi-threading, Worker Threads.                  |

#### 4. Why Itâ€™s Important in Projects?

- **Improved Efficiency**: Handle multiple tasks efficiently (e.g., API calls, file I/O).
- **Scalable Systems**: Manage state and synchronization effectively to handle large workloads.
- **Responsive UI**: In frontend apps, concurrency ensures UI remains responsive during background tasks.

#### 5. Using `Promise.all` vs. RxJS `forkJoin`

##### `Promise.all`

- Executes multiple promises concurrently and resolves when all are successful.
- **Failure Behavior**: If any promise fails, the entire operation fails.
- Example:

```typescript
async function fetchDashboardData() {
  const [users, orders] = await Promise.all([
    axios.get("/api/users"),
    axios.get("/api/orders"),
  ]);
  console.log({ users: users.data, orders: orders.data });
}
```

##### RxJS `forkJoin`

- Similar to `Promise.all` but built for observables. Emits combined results when all observables complete.
- **Failure Behavior**: By default, if any observable fails, the operation fails.
- Example:

```typescript
import { forkJoin, from } from "rxjs";
import { map } from "rxjs/operators";

const fetchUsers = () => from(axios.get("/api/users"));
const fetchOrders = () => from(axios.get("/api/orders"));

forkJoin([fetchUsers(), fetchOrders()])
  .pipe(
    map(([users, orders]) => ({
      users: users.data,
      orders: orders.data,
    }))
  )
  .subscribe(console.log);
```

#### 6. Handling Partial Success in RxJS

Use `catchError` to ensure successful tasks are delivered even if one fails.

```typescript
import { forkJoin, from, of } from "rxjs";
import { map, catchError } from "rxjs/operators";

const fetchUsers = () =>
  from(axios.get("/api/users")).pipe(catchError(() => of({ data: [] })));
const fetchOrders = () =>
  from(axios.get("/api/orders")).pipe(catchError(() => of({ data: [] })));

forkJoin([fetchUsers(), fetchOrders()])
  .pipe(
    map(([users, orders]) => ({
      users: users.data,
      orders: orders.data,
    }))
  )
  .subscribe(console.log);
```

#### 7. Enhanced RxJS Features

- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry failed tasks using the `retry` operator.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Combine streams of data for real-time dashboards.
- **Error Recovery**: Use `catchError` to recover from failures for each task.

---

#### 8. Practical Use Cases

- **Frontend**: Ensure UI responsiveness while fetching multiple API endpoints.
- **Backend**: Process large workloads in parallel (e.g., file uploads, report generation).
- **Real-Time Apps**: Combine real-time streams for dashboards or notifications.

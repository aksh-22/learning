Data Processing ->

1. View the data
2. Look the target
3. Balance the data ( look if any data is missing)
4. Scale the data
5. Scaling of data -> two type of scaling
    a. Normalization - 
                      formula -  X' = ( X - Xmin ) / ( Xmax - Xmin ) 
                      logic -    values between 0 and 1
                      
    b. standardization -
                      formula -  X' = ( X - mu ) / sd
                      logic -    values between -3 and +3
6. Extract the data (train | test | validation)                      
7. Apply algo ( KNN )

Data Processing ->

1. View the data
2. Select the target and features
3. Balance the data ( look if any data is missing)
4. Encoding data
    a. Categorical data
    b. Dependent Variable
5. Split the data (train | test | validation)                      
6. Scale the data
7. Scaling of data -> two type of scaling
    a. Normalization - 
                      formula -  X' = ( X - Xmin ) / ( Xmax - Xmin ) 
                      logic -    values between 0 and 1
                      
    b. standardization -
                      formula -  X' = ( X - mu ) / sd
                      logic -    values between -3 and +3
    c. which one to choose!?
    d. when to scale before or after splitting
    e. Fit transform and transform difference
8. Apply algo ( KNN )

queries :-

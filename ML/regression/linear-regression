1. import libraries
2. import data
    - and divide X ( features ) and Y ( target )
3. split data
    - X_train | X_test
    - Y_train | Y_test
    - test data size - 20%
    - train data size - 8 0%
4. Train the data using linear regression
    - use sklearn to import LinearRegression
    - regressor = LinearRegression()
    - regressor.fir(X_train,Y_train)

Assumptions of Linear Regression

1. Linearity (Linear relationship between Y and each X)
2. Homoscedasticity (Equal variance)
3. Multivariate Normality (Normality of error distribution)
4. Independence (of observations. Includes “no autocorrelation”)
5. Lack of Multicollinearity (Predictors are not correlated with each other)
6. The Outlier Check (This is not an assumption, but an “extra”)

building methods

1. All-in
2. Backward Elimination
3. Forward Selection
4. Bidirectional Selection ( Step-wise regression )
5. Score comparison


1. All-in -> 
  - prior knowledge ( for which columns to select )
  - Have to use ( based on business requirement we have to choose these columns )
  - Preparing for backward elimination.

2. Backward Elimination -> 
  a) select a significance level ( initial  SL = 0.5 )
  b) choose all the columns
  c) consider the predictor with the highest P-value.
      if- P > SL --> step D
      else       --> Go to final
  d) remove the predictor
  e) choose all columns except this variable

3. Forward Selection ->
  a) select a significance level ( initial  SL = 0.5 )
  b) fit all simple regression models y ~ Xn , select the one with lowest p value
  c) keep this variable and fit all possible model with one extra predictor added to the one(s) you already have
  d) consider the predictor with the lowest p value. 
      if P < SL --> go to step 3
      else      --> Go to final ( keep the previous model )

4. Bidirectional Selection ->
  a) select a significance level to stay and enter 
      SLENTER = 0.05 | SLSTAY = 0.05
  b) perform next step of Forward selection ( new variable must have P < SLENTER to enter)
  c) perform All step of Backward selection ( new variable must have P < SLSTAY to stay)
  d) No new variable can enter and no old variable can exit
      -> Finish

# Recursion vs Loop: Which One Should You Use for Batch Processing?

When implementing **batch processing** in backend systems, a common dilemma arises:

> **Should I use recursion or a loop to process batches of data?**

Both approaches can achieve the same outcome, but the _how_, _when_, and _why_ behind choosing one over the other can significantly impact performance, maintainability, and even system stability.

In this post, let‚Äôs break down the pros and cons, toss in some dev-humor, and see which one fits your use case better.

## A Real-World Example: Batch Processing in a CRON Job

In one of our production systems, we had a CRON job responsible for:

- Fetching `pending` orders from the database
- Marking them as `expired` if their deadline had passed

These orders were in the tens of thousands, so we processed them in **batches of 100** to avoid memory and DB stress.

We tried both **recursion** and **looping** ‚Äî and here‚Äôs what we discovered. Spoiler: One nearly took down the process like Thanos snapping half your stack frames.

---

## Option 1: Loop-Based Batch Processing

```ts
async function processOrdersInLoop() {
	let page = 0;
	const limit = 100;

	while (true) {
		const orders = await fetchOrders(page, limit);
		if (!orders.length) break;

		await updateStatuses(orders);
		page++;
	}
}
```

### Pros:

- Predictable memory usage
- No stack overflow (unless you forget to increment the page ‚Äî ask me how I know ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
- Ideal for large datasets

### Cons:

- Less elegant
- Retry logic can get verbose (like that one friend who overexplains everything)

---

## Option 2: Recursive Batch Processing

```ts
async function processOrdersRecursively(page = 0, limit = 100): Promise<void> {
	const orders = await fetchOrders(page, limit);
	if (!orders.length) return;

	await updateStatuses(orders);
	return processOrdersRecursively(page + 1, limit);
}
```

### Pros:

- Cleaner structure
- Easier to wrap with error handlers
- Functional and declarative (aka "feels fancy")

### Cons:

- Risk of `Maximum call stack size exceeded` ‚Äî and boom üí•, the server is down and you‚Äôre explaining recursion to your manager at 2 AM
- Not ideal for very large datasets

## Performance & Stack Safety: Key Differences

| Criteria                | Loop             | Recursion                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Stack-safe              | Yes              | No (risk of overflow)            |
| Elegant syntax          | Moderate         | High (and hipster-approved)      |
| Suitable for large data | Yes              | Not recommended                  |
| Retry on failure        | Harder to insert | Easy with try/catch in each call |

## Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

Want retry and clarity but also stack safety?

Use a **loop with a recursive retry wrapper** ‚Äî the dev equivalent of wearing sneakers with a suit: practical _and_ stylish.

```ts
async function retryWrapper(data: any[]) {
	try {
		await updateStatuses(data);
	} catch (e) {
		console.error('Retrying batch...', e);
		return retryWrapper(data); // Recursive retry
	}
}

async function processWithHybrid() {
	let page = 0,
		limit = 100;

	while (true) {
		const batch = await fetchOrders(page, limit);
		if (!batch.length) break;

		await retryWrapper(batch);
		page++;
	}
}
```

## Final Verdict: Which One Should You Use?

| Use Case                                 | Recommended Approach |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| < 1000 records, occasional job           | Recursion is okay    |
| Heavy-duty, large batch processing       | Loop is better       |
| Want functional readability              | Recursion            |
| Need stack-safe, production-stable logic | Loop (or hybrid)     |

## Summary

While recursion is **elegant**, **loops are battle-tested** for high-volume batch processing. They scale better, avoid crashes, and integrate well with logging and monitoring tools.

If you're just starting out or building for scale ‚Äî **use a loop**, wrap your risky business in helper functions, and sleep well at night.

Because nothing says "I love my uptime" like a stack that doesn‚Äôt overflow.

## FAQs

### 1. Can recursion ever be optimized to avoid stack overflows?

Yes! Some languages like Python and JavaScript engines like V8 don‚Äôt support tail call optimization well, but in languages that do (like Scheme or Scala), recursion can be stack-safe with tail calls.

### 2. What‚Äôs the performance difference between recursion and loop in Node.js?

Loops tend to be more memory-efficient and faster for large datasets. Recursion may add overhead due to additional stack frames, especially when deep recursion is involved.

### 3. Is recursion ever better for readability?

Absolutely. When processing tree-like or recursive data structures (like file systems, nested comments), recursion often results in clearer code.

### 4. Should I worry about async/await inside recursion?

Yes. Recursive functions using `async/await` can still cause stack overflow if not carefully managed. Always test with large datasets.

### 5. How do I test batch processing logic effectively?

Use mocking libraries like Jest or Sinon to simulate DB responses, and add unit tests for both success and failure conditions in each batch.

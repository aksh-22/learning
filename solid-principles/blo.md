### Proposal: Using a Separate Notification System vs Built-in NAV 2013 Email Notifications

#### ‚úÖ Summary Recommendation

We recommend building a **separate backend notification service** instead of relying on **NAV 2013's built-in email functionality**, even at the current volume of 100 emails/month. This ensures long-term scalability, observability, flexibility, and future-proofing as we scale to 5,000‚Äì30,000 emails/month.

### üìä Current & Future Email Volume

- **Now**: ~100 emails/month
- **Expected (Near Future)**: ~5,000 emails/month
- **Scalable Goal**: ~20,000‚Äì30,000 emails/month

### ‚ùå Limitations of NAV 2013 Built-in Email

| Limitation                       | Impact                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| No Queuing                       | Risk of timeout or failure during mass email dispatch |
| No Retry Logic                   | Failed emails go undetected and are not retried       |
| No Template Support              | Hard-coded emails, no dynamic formatting              |
| Poor Debugging                   | No logs or delivery status tracking                   |

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Queue Management     | Avoids overload, enables retries            |
| Logging & Monitoring | Track status, handle failures proactively   |
| Dynamic Templates    | HTML-rich, multi-language support           |
| Easy Integration     | Decoupled via API or DB polling             |
| Multi-Channel Future | Ready for SMS, WhatsApp, push notifications |
| SendGrid/SES Support | Use scalable email providers                |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Objections to Separate System (and How to Handle)

| Concern                                        | How We Handle It                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Security risks in moving data out of ERP"     | Use HTTPS, send minimal fields (no PII), add audit logging            |
| "Too complex to integrate with NAV 2013"       | Trigger via Job Queue or polling custom table using API calls         |
| "Feels like over-engineering for small volume" | Start with 2‚Äì3 templates + lightweight Node/NestJS setup, scale later |
| "Debugging will be harder outside ERP"         | Add correlation IDs + real-time email log dashboard                   |

---

### üí° Suggested Tech Stack

- **Backend**: NestJS with BullMQ
- **Queue**: Redis or in-memory fallback
- **Email Providers**: SendGrid (easy templating), or SES (cost-effective)
- **Integration Options**:
  - NAV writes to `EmailQueue` table ‚Üí backend polls & sends
  - NAV calls backend API directly (via COM/.NET call or middleware)

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

Implementing a separate notification service now gives us:

- More control
- Better error handling
- Future readiness (scalable from 5k to 30k emails/month)

It helps reduce technical debt, uncouples email logic from ERP, and creates a robust base for future communication features (SMS, multilingual emails, push notifications).
